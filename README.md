### This project was done as part of the Simplilearn FSD Master Course.

ICIN is one of the top banking firms that accepts deposits from the public for the purpose of lending loans to the public. 
Recently, the business analysts noticed a drop in the number of customers of the bank. 
They found out that online banking systems of banks like AXIS and American Express are gaining more profits by eliminating middlemen from the equation. 
As a result, the team decided to hire a Full Stack developer who can develop an online banking web application with a rich and user-friendly interface.
You are hired as one of the Full Stack Java developers and have been asked to develop the web application. 
The management team has provided you the requirements and their business model so that you can easily arrange different components of the application.
